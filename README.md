VBA-Src-Extractor
=================

This project provides an Excel AddIn that is tool to export/import VBA all the sources to/from a directory in one operation.

It can be used to backup or archive vba project modules and class files, for example, export files from a .xlsm file to a directory.

It can also be used to import project modules and class files into .xlsm or an empty .xlsx (which should then be saved as an .xlsm).

(VBA has the ability to import and export sources; however, it does it one file at a time meaning you have to deal with dialog boxes for each file.)
